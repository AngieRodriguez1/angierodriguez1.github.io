## Video Games I Recommend
* -[Fields of Mistria](https://www.fieldsofmistria.com/) -Still in early access but it's a cute, cozy, game with a 90s anime art style.
* -[Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/) -I've always loved roleplaying games and BG3 is _amazing_. It's very easy to get lost in playing it.
